The 3 checkpoint files demonstrate the checkpoint capability.
RUN_checkpoint_baseline provides a baseline comparison
RUN_checkpoint_create drops a checkpoint
RUN_checkpoint_restart restarts from the checkpoint dropped by
RUN_checkpoint_create.  It must be run *after* RUN_checkpoint_create.

log_state.csv provides long-term state data for comparison between the baseline
case and the restart case.

log_post_checkpoint.csv is a smaller file that logs data only in the time
immediately following the checkpoint.

Comparing the post_checkpoint file between the baseline and create runs
confirms that the dropping of a checkpoint has no effect on the simulation.

Comparing the same file between the baseline and the restart runs provides an
indication of the immediate error introduced by restarting from a checkpoint.

Comparing the log-state file between the baseline and the restart runs provides
an indication of the effect of propagating the restart errors.
