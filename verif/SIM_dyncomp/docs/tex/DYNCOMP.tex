\section{Introduction}
After any revision of the JEOD software there is a process of regression
testing. Each version of JEOD is verified and validated in two ways.  All releases
are tested for accuracy against trajectories of actual vehicles.  They are also
regression tested by comparing the results of individual model vetification
simulations, and by running combined simulations such as \DYNCOMPDesc.


The present version, as it becomes available, is tested against the last version
and checked for differences. This means all code,test runs, and documents are
checked against the previous JEOD as a truth model. Any differences between code,
documents and test runs for models that did not change have to be explained or
resolved.
Once resolution has been achieved, the data files for regression testing are
archived in
house in the JEOD directories. Any change -- whether it be a code change, model
addition, document changed or test run addition -- is documented in the top
level JEOD documents.
These documents are made
available, along with version notes at the time of JEOD official release.

The documentation for SIM\_dyncomp for this release is contained in the
following document:
A Process for Comparing Dynamics of Distributed Space Systems Simulations\cite{siw}.
It is hyperlinked here:
\DYNCOMLINK

The validation of these simulations are explained in the paper.
Note the validation data consisted of independent simulation to simulation
comparisons
and simple analytical models what could be computed independent of JEOD.

\section {SIM\_dyncomp S\_define}
For reference the SIM\_dyncomp S\_define is included here.  It relies
extensively on the standard JEOD S-modules:

\subsection{Preamble}

\begin{verbatim}
//===========================TRICK HEADER=====================
// PURPOSE:
//=============================================================================
// This simulation provides a reference implementation that can be used for
// comparison to other orbital dynamics implementations.  It is intended to
// provide a reference set for dynamics comparison.
//
// This simulation models a single vehicle in orbit around the Earth.  There
// are many adjustable configuration parameters that can be used to test out
// a suite of test cases with specific behavior.  These test cases form the
// basis for simulation to simulation comparison.
//
//          sys - Trick runtime executive and data recording routines
//         time - Representations of different clocks used in the sim
//     dynamics - Orbital dynamics
//          env - Environment: ephemeris, gravity
//          sun - Sun planetary model
//         moon - Moon planetary model
//        earth - Earth planetary model
//       vehicle - Space vehicle dynamics model
//
//=============================================================================
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define the job-calling intervals

\begin{verbatim}
// Define job calling intervals
#define LOW_RATE_ENV  60.00    // Low-rate environment update interval
#define DYNAMICS       0.03125 // Vehicle and plantary dynamics interval (32Hz)
\end{verbatim}

\item Include the standard job-priority definitions

\begin{verbatim}
// Define the phase initialization priorities.
#include "default_priority_settings.sm"
\end{verbatim}

\item Bring in the trick-system and jeod-system top-level modules

\begin{verbatim}
 // Include the default system classes:
#include "sim_objects/default_trick_sys.sm"
#include "jeod_sys.sm"
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time}
Use the standard jeod\_time.sm sim-module; in addition to the default TAI
clock, add UT1, UTC, TT, and GMST.  Also specify that the clocks should have
their calendar representations computed out.

\begin{verbatim}
// Set up desired time types and include the JEOD time S_module
#define TIME_MODEL_UT1
#define TIME_MODEL_UTC
#define TIME_MODEL_TT
#define TIME_MODEL_GMST
#define TIME_CALENDAR_UPDATE_INTERVAL  DYNAMICS
#include "jeod_time.sm"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Dynamics}
Use the standard dynamics sim-object.
\begin{verbatim}
#include "dynamics.sm"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Environment}
Use the standard environment sim-object, with sun, moon and earth planetary
bodies.

\begin{verbatim}
#include "environment.sm"
#include "sun_basic.sm"
#include "moon_basic.sm"
\end{verbatim}
For earth, use the full earth model with a spherical harmonic gravity, MET
atmosphere, and RNP.  For legacy reasons, we use the (older) GEMT1 gravity
model rather than the default GGM02C model.
\begin{verbatim}
#define JEOD_OVERRIDE_GGM02C_WITH_GEMT1
#include "earth_GGM02C_MET_RNP.sm"
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Vehicle}
We want some specific capabilities for our vehicle, so we will build a new
vehicle sim-object based off one of the standard S-modules.

\subsubsection{Model Headers}
\begin{verbatim}
/*****************************************************************************
Vehicle Sim Object
Purpose:(Provides the vehicle object)
*****************************************************************************/
// Include headers for classes that this class contains:
##include "dynamics/body_action/include/dyn_body_init_lvlh_rot_state.hh"
##include "dynamics/derived_state/include/euler_derived_state.hh"
##include "dynamics/derived_state/include/lvlh_derived_state.hh"
##include "dynamics/derived_state/include/orb_elem_derived_state.hh"
##include "dynamics/dyn_body/include/force.hh"
##include "dynamics/dyn_body/include/torque.hh"
##include "interactions/gravity_torque/include/gravity_torque.hh"
##include "environment/atmosphere/include/atmosphere.hh"
##include "interactions/aerodynamics/include/aero_drag.hh"

// Include default data classes:
##include "interactions/aerodynamics/data/include/aero_model.hh"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Inheritance}
Note - we use the sim-object version found in Base.  This is just the
definition, without the instantiation.
\begin{verbatim}
// include the base class defintion.
#include "Base/vehicle_atmosphere.sm"
class VehicleSimObject : public VehicleAtmSimObject
{
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Content}
Note - this is the content in addition to the content of the
VehicleAtmSimObject.
