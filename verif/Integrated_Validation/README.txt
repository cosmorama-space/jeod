These Sim directories are the simulation scenarios and tests which measure JEOD against emperical data.
SIM_Earth_Moon are a set of 7 comparisons of seven vehicles, five in Earth orbit, one in Lunar orbit
and one swing by hyperbolic encounter with the Earth. Comparison is made to precison fit measured data.
Note that only "RUN_clem" and "RUN_rosetta" of "SIM_Earth_Moon" is currently available in the public release version.

SIM_Grace, which currently available only in the NASA internal release, is a two vehicle simulation of
Grace mission with JEOD data compared to real measured Grace data. 

SIM_Mars is a Mars swing by maneuver compared to real measured data.
