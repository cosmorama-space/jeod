\chapter{Requirements}\hyperdef{chapter}{reqts}{}\label{sec:reqts}

\requirement{Documentation}
\label{reqt:documentation}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    The documentation for JEOD and each model shall include:

    \subrequirement{}
    \label{reqt:reqts_doc}
      Software requirements specification.

    \subrequirement{}
    \label{reqt:design_doc}
      Software, interface, and software version descriptions.

    \subrequirement{}
    \label{reqt:user_doc}
      User Guide.

    \subrequirement{}
    \label{reqt:test_doc}
      Software test procedures and results.

  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    The listed items are needed to comply with NASA NPR 7150.2A as a Class C product.

  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection
\end{description}

\requirement{JEOD Coding Standards}
\label{reqt:jeod_code}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    All source code written for JEOD shall shall follow the Coding Standards \cite{dynenv:CODE_STANDARD}. All exceptions must be waved and documented.

  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    All model source code will be written, commented, and documented using the same standard so the code is easy to maintain and understand, which complies with NASA NPR 7150.2A.

  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Main Function}
\label{reqt:main_function}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  The JEOD Software Package shall provide the ability to model spacecraft trajectories, capable of supporting the orbital six degree of freedom propagation of multiple vehicles around multiple planets.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  This is the main functional requirement of JEOD.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test, Analysis.
\end{description}

\requirement{Relative States}
\label{reqt:rel_states}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  JEOD shall provide the capability to represent and extract relative states for any simulated vehicle in relation to other vehicles and/or planets.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  The capability to represent and extract relative states is necessary to support multi-vehicle, multi-planet simulation.  It is also required by simulation users for many end applications such as rendezvous and proximity operations.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
 Inspection, Test.
\end{description}

\requirement {Simulation Interface}
\label{reqt:sim_interface}
\begin{description}
 \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
JEOD shall provide  a generic interface for a simulation engine which will support:
\subrequirement {}
\label {reqt:trick}
Simulations made with the Trick simulation package
\subrequirement {}
\label {reqt:nontrick}
Simulations independent of the Trick simulation package
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
Compatibility with Trick is required to support a large body of existing simulation code.  Trick independence promotes reuse in other environments.

  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test.
\end{description}
