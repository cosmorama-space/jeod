\chapter{Assumptions and Limitations on Earth Orientation}\label{ap:eartho}
The use of GGM02C has important implications due to requirements contained in the GRACE geopotential campaign \cite{grace}. A non-spherical gravity field was fit using a model of the Earth's orientation that differs from the one in JEOD. The difference as of the present time is quite small. JEOD uses an Earth orientation known as the IAU-76/FK5 \cite{Bond1} and the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac \cite{ES1}, which conformed to an older Goddard gravity model used in Trick Dynamics in the 1990's. However in 2003 the International Earth Rotational Service (IERS) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory adopted a system under the name J2000. The Earth orientation model simplifies polar motion and introduces a new formulation for the construction of a new RNP \cite{IERS2003}. Vallado \cite{VMcC} notes that as time goes by IAU-76/FK and J2000 models will diverge. This has been noted as a JEOD issue and will be addressed in later releases. The J2000 coordinate system is defined by( see reference \cite{IERS2003}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Coordinate Frame: Non-Rotating Inertial,
\item Z-axis: Defined as the pole vector of the Earth Mean Equator of J2000 (where J2000 = Julian date 2451545.0 TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time)),
\item X-axis: Defined as the cross product of the Z-axis (as defined above) and the Earth mean orbit pole of J2000 (i.e. the ecliptic pole of J2000). The X-axis of this coordinate frame is the Earth vernal equinox of J2000,
\item Y-axis: Completes a standard, right-handed coordinate frame.
\end{enumerate}
For futher information on coordinate systems see \COORDLINK

\chapter{Assumptions about Lunar Orientation}\label{ap:moono}
The Lunar orientation is extracted from the JPL Development  Ephemeris by extraction from fitted data. It should be noted that the specified non-spherical Lunar gravity model does not have an analytic RNP model similar to the Earth. The lunar libration (lunar orientation) data are present on the JPL Development  Ephemeris file, and this software uses this libration data to determine the directions of the Moon's pole and prime meridian. Further information from JPL is linked to this document see the JPL Lunar Constants document \LUNARLINK .


\chapter{Definition of RSW System} \label{ap:rsw}
The radial, in-track and cross-track coordinate system is defined by Vallado \cite{VMcC}: (The term RSW is somewhat arbitrary and of historical origin; the designation R is 'radial', S and W.)
Origin:	Any Point of Interest
Orientation:	The R-S plane is the instantaneous orbit plane at epoch.
	The R axis lies along the geocentric radius vector to the point of interest and is positive radially outward.
	The W axis lies along the instantaneous orbital angular momentum vector at epoch and is positive in the direction of the  angular momentum vector.
	The S axis completes the right-handed triad (See Figure \ref{fig:7a}).



   {\bf{r}} = position vector  \\
   {\bf{v}} = velocity vector
\[
{\rm{\hat r}} = \frac{{\bf{r}}}{{\rm{r}}}
\]

\[
{\bf{\hat w}} = \frac{{{\bf{r}} \times {\bf{v}}}}{{\left| {{\bf{r}} \times {\bf{v}}} \right|}}
\]

\[
{\bf{\hat s}} = {\bf{w}} \times {\bf{r}}
\]
