\begin{abstract}
The JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics (JEOD) Software Package contains a set of numerical mathematical models that provide vehicle or vehicles trajectory generation by the solution of a set of numerical dynamical models.  These models are comprised of an Environment model representing the gravitational and non-gravitational forces and torques acting on the vehicle or vehicles, Dynamics models for processing and numerically integrating the equations of motion, Interaction models representing interaction with the environment and a set of mathematical and orbital dynamics Utilities.
This document presents three topics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An introduction to the JEOD package and its component models.
\item An overview of the design of the JEOD package and how the models are used together.
\item A top level description of verification and validation of JEOD with measured data.
\end{enumerate}
\end{abstract}
