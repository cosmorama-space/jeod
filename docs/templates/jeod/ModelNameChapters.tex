\section{Model Description}
%%% Incorporate the intro paragraph that used to begin this Chapter here.
%%% This is location of the true introduction where you explain why this 
%%% model exists.
%%% Identify the Model context within JEOD.

\section{Document History}
%%% Status of this and only this document.  Any date should be relevant to when 
%%% this document was last updated and mention the reason (release, bug fix, etc.)
%%% Mention previous history aka JEOD 1.4-5 heritage in this section.

\section{Document Organization}
This document is formatted in accordance with the 
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard~\cite{NASA:SWE} 
and is organized into the following chapters:

\begin{description}
%% longer chapter descriptions, more information.

\item[Chapter 1: Introduction] - 
This introduction contains three sections: description of model, document history, and organization.  
The first section provides the introduction to the \ModelNameDesc\ and its reason 
for existance.  It also contains a brief description of the interconnections with other models, and 
references to any supporting documents.  The second section displays the history of this document which includes
author, date, and reason for each revision; it also lists the document that is parent to this one.  The final
section contains a description of the how the document is organized.

\item[Chapter 2: Product Requirements] - 
Describes requirements for the \ModelNameDesc.

\item[Chapter 3: Product Specification] - 
Describes the underlying theory, architecture, and design of the \ModelNameDesc\ in detail.  It is organized in 
three sections: Conceptual Design, Mathematical Formulations, and Detailed Design.

\item[Chapter 4: User Guide] - 
Describes how to use the \ModelNameDesc\ in a Trick simulation.  It is broken into three sections to represent the JEOD 
defined user types: Analysts or users of simulations (Analysis), Integrators or developers of simulations (Integration),
and Model Extenders (Extension).

\item[Chapter 5: Verification and Validation] -  
Contains \ModelNameDesc\ verification and validation procedures and results.

\chapter{Product Requirements}\hyperdef{part}{reqt}{}\label{ch:reqt}
%----------------------------------
This model shall meet the JEOD project requirements specified in the 
\hyperref{file:\JEODHOME/docs/JEOD.pdf}{part1}{reqt}{JEOD} top-level document.

%%% Format for the model Requirements is open.  It should include requirements for this model 
%%% only and use requirment tags like the one below.

\chapter{User Guide}\hyperdef{part}{user}{}\label{ch:user}
%----------------------------------
The Analysis section of the user guide is intended primarily for users of pre-existing simulations.  
It contains: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a description of how to modify \ModelNameDesc\ variables after the simulation 
has compiled, including an in-depth discussion of the input file,
\item an overview of how to interpret (but not edit) the S\_define file,
\item a sample of some of the typical variables that may be logged.
\end{itemize}

The Integration section of the user guide is intended for simulation developers.  
It describes the necessary configuration of the \ModelNameDesc\ within an 
S\_define file, and the creation of standard run directories.  The latter 
component assumes a thorough understanding of the preceding Analysis section of the user guide.
Where applicable, the user may be directed to selected portions of Product Specification (Chapter \ref{ch:spec}).

The Extension section of the user guide is intended primarily for developers 
needing to extend the capability of the \ModelNameDesc\.  Such users should have a 
thorough understanding of how the model is used in the preceding 
Integration section, and of the model 
specification (described in Chapter \ref{ch:spec}).
