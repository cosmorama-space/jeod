Compile with
g++ -combine main.cc ../../../src/gauss_quadrature.cc

Note - for a Trick sim, having a #include"utils/math/gauss_quadrature.hh" in the target model
will suffice to bring in gauss_quadrature.cc.


This test runs a series of polynomials up to order 15 through the gauss
quadrature function.  The test computes the analytic solution and compares it
to the gauss quadrature solution for 4 different sets of integration ranges for
each polynominal.

The test then continues to compute the integral of some analytic functions and
compare those results to the results from gauss quadrature.
