\begin{abstract}
The JEOD \mathDesc\ performs commonly used mathematical operations on
3-by-3 (3x3) matrices and 3-by-1 (3x1) vectors.  The model consists of functions
that are called by other JEOD functions.  The functions
are {\it not} intended to be called at the Trick S\_define level.  Therefore,
the \mathDesc\ is primarily of interest to simulation developers
(programmers) more than simulation users (analysts) and integrators.

This document describes the implementation of the \mathDesc\ including
the model requirements, specifications, mathematical theory,
and architecture.  A user guide is also provided to assist
with implementing the model in Trick simulations.
