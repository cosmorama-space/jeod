\begin{abstract}

The \ModelDesc provides a generic bridge between the models which
comprise JEOD and a simulation environment where they operate.  The
\ModelDesc uses abstract classes to specify contracts between JEOD
models and message handling, memory allocation and
integration services provided by the simulation environment.
There is also a suite of preprocessor macros which provide the simulation
environment access to protected fields within JEOD classes for the purposes
of initialization and logging.

The \ModelDesc includes Trick-specific implementations of all required
interfaces as well as conditional definitions for the macros appropriate for
use with Trick.  All JEOD simulations require instantiation of exactly one
JeodSimulationInterface class in order to function.
