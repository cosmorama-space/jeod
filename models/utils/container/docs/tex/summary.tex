\begin{abstract}

The \ModelDesc forms a component of the utilities suite of
models within \JEODid. It is located at
models/utils/container.

The model has two overarching goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a generic framework for saving to and restoring from a checkpoint
file those resources that are opaque to the typical simulation engine.
\item Provide checkpointable and restorable replacements for
selected Standard Template Library (STL) container class templates
(list, vector, and set).
\end{itemize}

The \ModelDesc implements these goals in the form of
\Cplusplus classes and class templates.
