\test{Container Simulation}\label{test:sim}
\begin{description}
\item[Test Directory]
{\tt models/utils/container/verif/SIM\_container\_T10}

\item[Test Description]
This unit test exercises the checkpoint / restart capabilities of the
model.

To run the test, enter the test directory and type the command
{\tt CP build} to build the test program and then run the resultant
executable with each of the four run directories. The non-restart
run directories must be run prior to running the restart directories.

\item[Success Criteria]
The success criteria involve analyzing the detailed output that results
from running the program.
\begin{itemize}
\item The simulation must build and each run directory shall
run to completion.
\item The two checkpoint tests (SET\_test/RUN\_empty and SET\_test/RUN\_full)
must produce Trick and JEOD checkpoint files that reflect the contents
of the containers.
\item the two restart tests (SET\_test/RUN\_empty\_restart and
SET\_test/RUN\_full\_restart) must restore from the appropriate checkpoint
file and must report the same content as reported by the corresponding
checkpoint test.
\end{itemize}

\item[Test Results]
The test passes.

\item[Applicable Requirements]
This test demonstrates the satisfaction of the 
requirement \traceref{reqt:chkpt}.
