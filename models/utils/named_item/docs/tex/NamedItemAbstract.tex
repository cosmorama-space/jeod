% INSERT TEXT HERE
The \NamedItemDesc\ is really not a model in any normal sense of the word.
It is simply a class which contains several static methods for concatenating 1 or more character strings into a new string in which the original strings are separated by a dot, e.g.
construct\_name("foo", "bar") returns "foo.bar".
