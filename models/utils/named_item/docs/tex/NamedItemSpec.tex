\section{Conceptual Design}
The \NamedItemDesc\ is a single class with no instance fields or methods.  It's content 
consists of $7$ construct\_name static methods 
which construct dot-conjoined names from $1$ to $7$ input string arguments; two generic methods 
for constructing dot-conjoined strings from a variable number of arguments (null terminated); 
and a method for determining a suffix of a dot-conjoined string given an input prefix.  These
methods are basic C++ functions which serve their intended purpose and play no role in the object design of JEOD.
