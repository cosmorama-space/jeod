The \ModelDesc comprises several classes that provide various mechanisms
for numerically integrating a changing state over time and provide mechanisms
for coordinating this integration across multiple bodies.
The model is used in \JEODid to integrate the translational
and rotational states of dynamic bodies.

The provided capabilities include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Numerically integrating the state described by a 2nd order ODE (e.g. a 
body state) over time using one of a variety of numerical
integration techniques.
\item Updating time in a manner consistent with the numerical integration
technique used to propagate states,
\item Providing an interface to the techniques in \erseven to leverage 
services including numerical integration and resource management
, and
\item Constructing an integrator constructor using the Trick integration
structure as a guideline.
\end{itemize}
