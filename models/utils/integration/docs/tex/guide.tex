\chapter{User Guide}\hyperdef{part}{user}{}\label{ch:user}
The User Guide is divided into three instruction sets:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Instructions for Simulation Users}.  This instruction-set 
 contains a description of how to modify \ModelDesc\ variables within an 
 existing simulation, including a discussion of the input file and 
 an overview of how to interpret (but not edit) the S\_define file.
 \item \textbf{Instructions for Simulation Developers}.  This instruction-set 
 builds on the previous set, adding information on the necessary 
 configuration of the \ModelDesc\ within an S\_define file, and the creation 
 of 
 standard run directories.
 \item \textbf{Instructions for Model Developers}.   This instruction-set 
 builds on the previous set, and adds information on the potential for 
 extending the model to perform tasks that are beyond its current abilities, 
 such as adding new integration algorithms.
\end{enumerate}
