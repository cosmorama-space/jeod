\inspection{Top-level Inspection}
\label{inspect:TLI}
This document structure, the code, and associated files have been inspected, 
and together satisfy requirement~\traceref{reqt:toplevel}.


\inspection{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{inspect:math}
The implementations of the various integration techniques
implement the corresponding algorithms as described in
section~\ref{sec:algorithms}.

By inspection, the \ModelDesc partially satisfies
requirements~\traceref{reqt:supported_er7_techniques}
and~\traceref{reqt:long_arc_integration}.


\inspection{Design Inspection}
\label{inspect:design}
The model design uses a set of abstract classes. Each supported technique 
builds
upon these abstract classes using a common scheme.  This scheme of using
derived classes enables extensions to the model, one of the key goals of (and
requirements on) the model. A new model comprises extensions to three abstract 
classes. The TwoStateIntegrator class abstractly propagates generalized
position and velocity. The TimeIntegrator class abstractly propagates time
in concert with the state integrator. The IntegratorConstructor creates
new instances of the state and time integrator.

By inspection, the \ModelDesc partially satisfies
requirements~\traceref{reqt:use_er7_utils},
~\traceref{reqt:extensibility}, 
~\traceref{reqt:integration_problems},
~\traceref{reqt:multiple_states},
and ~\traceref{reqt:multiple_integrators}.
