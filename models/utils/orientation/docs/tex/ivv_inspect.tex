\inspection{Top-level Inspection}
\label{inspect:TLI}
This document structure, the code, and associated files have been inspected, and together satisfy requirement~\ref{reqt:toplevel}.

\inspection{Representations}
\label{inspect:representations}
The model design hinges on a single class, the Orientation class.
This class defines two enumerations, one of which identifies each of the required
representation schemes. Public member data exist to represent each required
representation scheme.
Non-static member functions exist to
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that some desired representation is consistent with input data,
\item Set the orientation object to a specified value in any of the supported
representation schemes (setters),
\item Retrieve the equivalent value of an orientation in any of the supported
representation schemes (getters).
\end{itemize}

By inspection, the \ModelDesc satisfies
requirements~\ref{reqt:representations} and~\ref{reqt:data_access}.


\inspection{Euler Angles}
\label{inspect:euler}
The Orientation class also defines an enumeration that identifies all twelve
Euler angle sequences. The six aerodynamics sequences defined in the latter are
numerically identical to the corresponding values in the Trick implementation.
Each of the three static conversion methods that pertain to Euler angles handle
all twelve sequences.

By inspection, the \ModelDesc satisfies
requirement~\ref{reqt:euler_angles}.


\inspection{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{inspect:math}
The implementations of the static conversion methods
implement the corresponding algorithms as described in
section~\ref{sec:mathematics}.

By inspection, the \ModelDesc satisfies
requirement~\ref{reqt:conversions}.
