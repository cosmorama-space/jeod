\begin{abstract}

Many environmental effects can interact with a vehicle in orbit. Often,
to accurately model these effects, models of the
surface geometry of the vehicle are necessary. It is often
useful to be able to use one surface geometry to calculate many
different environmental interactions with the vehicle. Additionally,
it is important to allow both for new interactions to be applied to
existing surface models, as well as for the extension of new ways of
modeling the surface geometry.

The \ModelDesc gives an extensible framework for representing
the surface geometry of a vehicle. This framework can be used to produce
models appropriate for calculating any user defined environmental
interaction. Additionally, it is extensible to user defined
repesentations of surface geometry.
