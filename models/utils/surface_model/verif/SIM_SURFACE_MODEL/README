The Surface  Model validation run will output various surface info
based on input file configuration. This output should match that seen 
in SET_test_val/RUN_surface_model_ver/run.out, if the model is working 
correctly. 

After compiling the sim, you can run it with the scripts in the bin
directory. Simply enter the following command to send the output
of the sim to file run.out

$> bin/run_test > run.out

The run.out file should match data in SET_test_val/RUN_surface_model_ver/run.out
