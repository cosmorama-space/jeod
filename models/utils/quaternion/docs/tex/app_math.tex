\chapter{Quaternion Mathematics}\label{sec:app_math}

The JEOD uses unit quaternions\cite{kuipers:2002} as one of several means
for representing rotations and transformations in three space.
This section provides an overview on the use of quaternions in the
JEOD.  The contents of this section are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_nomen} defines the nomenclature used in this
chapter.
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_fund} establishes the fundamentals of
quaternions.
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_arith} develops elementary quaternion
arithmetic.
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_exp} describes the extension of the exponential
and logarithm
to the quaternions.
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_rot_trans} describes how quaternions are used to
represent transformations and rotations.
\item Section~\ref{sec:app_time_deriv} develops the time derivative of a
transformation quaternion.
\item Sections~\ref{sec:app_att_prop} and~\ref{sec:app_rate_prop}
describes techniques for propagating vehicle attitude and attitude rate
using quaternions.
