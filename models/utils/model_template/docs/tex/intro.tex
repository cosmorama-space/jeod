% Usage instructions:
% IMPORTANT: Do not modify this file.
% Instead fill in the files model_purpose.tex and change_history.tex.
%
% This file needs no modification. The introductory chapter is primarily
% boilerplate material common to all model documents. There are two places in
% in the introductory chapter where model-specific content is needed, the
% description of the model and the model document change history. This file
% \inputs two model-specific files to put that model-specific info into
% the model document. These files are:
% - model_purpose.tex
%   Contains a brief description of the model.
% - change_history.tex
%   Contains a table that summarizes changes to the model document.
