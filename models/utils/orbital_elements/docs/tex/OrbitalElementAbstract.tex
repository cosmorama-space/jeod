The orbital elements class provides a representation of the translational
orbital state of an orbital body in standard Keplerian orbital elements.  In
addition, this class provides methods for converting between the Keplerian
orbital elements and planet centered inertial Cartesian position and velocity
vectors.  The methods in this class are primarily based on the methods
presented in Vallado \cite{Vallado} although some modifications have been made
to increase the numerical accuracy of the routines in limiting cases.
