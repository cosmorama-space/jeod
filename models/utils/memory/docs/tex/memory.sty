% {MODEL DESCRIPTION} should be changed to the full name of the model.  
%   For consistency with the text, the name should be a noun, possibly
%   finishing with the word "Model", e.g. "Time Model", not "Time"  ("The Time
%   Model works by ..."  vs "The Time works by").  
%   The name should be a singular, not plural value,
%   e.g. "Reference Frame Model", 
%   not "Reference Frames" (same example).
