The Message Handler Model validation run will output messages based
on the input file configuration.

After compiling the sim, run SET_test/RUN_test/input.py to see the
error messages.

This output can be compared against the record in
SET_test_val/RUN_test/run.out

Note that the comparison output in run.out shows only which messages get
displayed and which do not (justification: error messages include full paths
which will never be reproduceable on another system or for another user).

This file should be reproduceable by sending the error messages (which go to
stdout) elsewhere:
S_main_[tab-complete] SET_test/RUN_test/input.py > /dev/null

Without the stdout messages, the output should match that found in run.out.
