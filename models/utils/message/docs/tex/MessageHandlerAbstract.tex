% INSERT TEXT HERE
The MessageHandler class provides a generic framework for routing various
informational, warning, error and failure messages to the user.
The TrickMessageHandler derived class provides the specific implementation of these capabilities within the Trick environment.
The message model is designed in such a way that the user can configure selective suppression of
various message types.  The user may customize the message format by specifying whether
error codes and location information should be included.

This document describes the implementation of the \MessageHandlerDesc.  It is part
of a series of inter-related documents that describe the model requirements,
specifications, and architecture of the model.  A user
guide is also provided to assist with implementing the model in Trick
simulations.
