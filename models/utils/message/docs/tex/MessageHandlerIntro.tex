The JEOD \MessageHandlerDesc\ provides a convenient, 
flexible, consistent facility for users and developers alike to
communicate information and program status back to the user through a TTY 
interface.  The \MessageHandlerDesc\ offers
parameters which control the format of messages and the level of screening desired, thereby 
allowing flexibility for users and developers to specify which messages will
be sent and how they should be formatted under various conditions.

Most of the JEOD models and simulations make liberal use of the \MessageHandlerDesc\ 
in order to convey information regarding the state of the simulation, 
errors, warnings, debug information 
and failure conditions.  The control capabilities allow output to 
range from maximum debugging verbosity to a clean run of a production sim.
