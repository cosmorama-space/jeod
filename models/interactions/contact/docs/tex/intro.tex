\boilerplatechapterone{
The \ModelDesc is designed to provide a way for dynamic bodies created with the \DYNBODY~\cite{dynenv:DYNBODY} to interact beyond mere mass attachment.  Without the \ModelDesc, dynamic bodies are completely separate entities that can not influence each other's state if they are not attached via a mass tree~\cite{dynenv:MASS}.  Using the \ModelDesc surfaces can be defined which generate forces when they are inter-penetrated (contacted) by surfaces on other dynamic bodies.  The basic infrastructure provided by the \ModelDesc is designed to be extended allowing for the simulation of detailed docking, grappling, and birthing operations.}
