%----------------------------------
\requirement{JEOD Requirements}
\label{reqt:jeod}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall meet the JEOD project requirements specified in the \JEODid\
  \hyperref{file:\JEODHOME/docs/JEOD.pdf}{part1}{reqt}{top-level document}~\cite{dynenv:JEOD} .
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  This model shall, at a minimum, meet all external and internal requirements applied to the
  \JEODid\ release.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection
  \end{description}

\requirement{Contact Between Surfaces in 3D Space}
\label{reqt:Contact_Surfaces}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
     The \ModelDesc shall determine if two or more 3D surfaces are in contact and resolve the
     resultant forces utilizing user defined dynamics.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     Contact between surfaces is the core functionality of the \ModelDesc.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Provide a Default Contact Force Model Based on Springs}
\label{reqt:Contact_Spring_Default}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
     The \ModelDesc shall provide default contact dynamics functionality based on simple springs.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     A basic contact force generation model needed to be provided with the \ModelDesc and has been in
     the form of a simple spring.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Limit Circular Contact}
\label{reqt:Circular_Contact}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    The \ModelDesc shall limit contact determination to surfaces that do not reside on the same vehicle or attached vehicles.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     In order to avoid potential circular contact or attachments, which are not allowed in JEOD, surfaces residing on the same
     body or tree are excluded from contacting each other.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{\ModelDesc Extensibility}
\label{reqt:contact_extend}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    The \ModelDesc shall be extensible.
    \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    Other objects and classes should be able to derive from components of the \ModelDesc.
    \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection
  \end{description}
