\section{Purpose and Objectives of the \ThermalRiderDesc}
\input{ThermalRiderIntroduction}

\section{Context within JEOD}
The following document is parent to this document:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\href{file:\JEODHOME/docs/JEOD.pdf}
           {\em JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics}}
			  \cite{dynenv:JEOD}
\end{itemize}

The \ThermalRiderDesc\ forms a component of the \ModelClass\ suite of
models within \JEODid. It is located at
models/\ModelClass/ThermalRider.  It is used primarily by the
\href{file:\JEODHOME/models/interactions/radiation_pressure/docs/radiation_pressure.pdf}{Radiation
Pressure}~\cite{dynenv:RADIATIONPRESSURE} model, where it can be used in
conjunction with radiation pressure, or as a stand-alone model for simply
monitoring temperature.  It may also be used in the
\href{file:\JEODHOME/models/interactions/aerodynamics/docs/aerodynamics.pdf}{Aerodynamic
Drag}~\cite{dynenv:AERODYNAMICS} model.

\section{Documentation History}
\input{ThermalRiderIntro_change_history}


\section{Documentation Organization}
This document is formatted in accordance with the
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard~\cite{NASA:SWE}
and is organized into the following chapters:

\begin{description}
%% longer chapter descriptions, more information.

\item[Chapter 1: Introduction] -
This introduction contains four sections; purpose and objective,
context within JEOD, document history, and document organization.

\item[Chapter 2: Product Requirements] -
Describes requirements for the \ThermalRiderDesc.

\item[Chapter 3: Product Specification] -
Describes the underlying theory, architecture, and design of the
\ThermalRiderDesc\ in detail.  It will be organized in
four sections; Conceptual Design, Mathematical Formulations, Detailed
Design, and Version Inventory.

\item[Chapter 4:  User's Guide] -
Describes how to use the \ThermalRiderDesc\ in a Trick simulation.  It
is broken into three sections to represent the JEOD
defined user types; Analysts or users of simulations (Analysis),
Integrators or developers of simulations (Integration),
and Model Extenders (Extension).

\item[Chapter 5: Verification and Validation] -
Contains \ThermalRiderDesc\ verification and validation procedures and
results.

\chapter{User's Guide}\hyperdef{part}{user}{}\label{ch:user}
%----------------------------------
The User's Guide is divided into 3 components, one for each of three
different types of user.

The Analysis section of the User's Guide is intended primarily for
users of pre-existing simulations.
It comprises the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item A description of how to modify \ThermalRiderDesc\ variables after
the simulation
has compiled, including an in-depth discussion of the input file;
\item An overview of how to interpret (but not edit) the S\_define
file;
\item A sample of some of the typical variables that may be logged.
\end{itemize}

The Integration section of the User's Guide is intended for simulation
developers.
It describes the necessary configuration of the \ThermalRiderDesc\
within an
S\_define file, and the creation of standard run directories.  The
latter
component assumes a thorough understanding of the preceding Analysis
section of the user guide.
Where applicable, the user may be directed to selected portions of
Product Specification (Chapter \ref{ch:spec}).

The Extension section of the User's Guide is intended primarily for
developers
needing to extend the capability of the \ThermalRiderDesc.  Such users
should have a
thorough understanding of how the model is used in the preceding
Integration section, and of the model
specification (described in Chapter \ref{ch:spec}).
