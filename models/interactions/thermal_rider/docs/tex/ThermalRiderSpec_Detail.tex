\section{Detailed Design}

This section is divided into 2 parts:


\begin{itemize}
\item A process flow-through description, or Process Architecture of the sequence in which the
various functions are called, and the interaction between the objects.
\item An alphabetized list of the objects that comprise the
\ThermalRiderDesc, 
with reference to the parent class where appropriate, and description
of the functions contained within those object.
\end{itemize}

Further, the 
\href{file:refman.pdf} {\em Reference Manual} \cite{thermalbib:ReferenceManual}
contains a
structural overview of the \ThermalRiderDesc.
