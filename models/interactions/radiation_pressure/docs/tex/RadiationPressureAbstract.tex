\begin{abstract}

The magnitude of the radiation pressure force on a spacecraft is generally
small; it has negligible effect on short-duration operations, and is typically
insignificant -- compared to aerodynamic drag and gravitational variabilities --
in Low Earth Orbit.
Nevertheless, the cumulative effect over long-duration operations can produce
a significant perturbation to the vehicle trajectory, and to orbital characteristics.
The \RadiationPressureDesc\ allows for the incorporation of radiative forces
into to \JEODid\ package for state propagation.
