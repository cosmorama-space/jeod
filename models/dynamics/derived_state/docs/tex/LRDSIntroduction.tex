%\section{Purpose and Objectives of \LDRSDesc}
% Incorporate the intro paragraph that used to begin this Chapter here.
% This is location of the true introduction where you explain what this model
% does.

The \LRDSDesc\ provides a means to express the state of a vehicle
with respect to the Local-Vertical-Local-Horizontal (LVLH) of any
translational state (position and velocity) and planet for which LVLH can be
defined as in ~\ref{ch:LVLHspec}. In addition to the customary rectilinear
LVLH system, the \LRDSDesc\ offers a curvilinear option in which the
rectilinear X-axis is replaced by a planet-centered circle through the
system origin and within its plane of motion.
