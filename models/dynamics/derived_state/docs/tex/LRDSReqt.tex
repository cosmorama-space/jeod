%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% add text here to describe general model requirements
% text is of the form:
\requirement{Rectilinear LVLH  representation}
\label{reqt:RLVLH}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
     The LVLH Relative Derived State shall provide the capability to express the
state of one body in the rectilinear LVLH reference frame based on a reference
point and reference planet.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     Capability from JEOD 1.5.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
     Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Curvilinear LVLH  representation}
\label{reqt:CLVLH}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
     The LVLH Relative Derived State shall provide the capability to express the
state of one body in the curvilinear LVLH reference frame based on a reference
point and reference planet.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     Capability from JEOD 1.5.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
     Test
\end{description}
