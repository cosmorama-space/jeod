\section*{Abstract}

When describing the state of a vehicle, we are describing the translational and rotational position and
velocity with respect to some reference frame.  For simplicity, the integration
of a vehicular state is performed in an inertial reference frame, but the input
and output of that state may be expressed in any of a boundless set of
representations, such as LVLH or Orbital Elements.  The Derived State model provides the capability to express a
vehicular state in one or more of the most frequently used representations, and
the extension capability to define other representations not released with
\JEODid.
