\section{Mathematical Formulations}

The \NEDDesc\ contains no independent mathematical formulations; the mathematics utilized by the model is provided by the North-East-Down subset of the planet-fixed model, and by the Reference Frames model;  see the \href{file:\JEODHOME/models/utils/planet_fixed/docs/planet_fixed.pdf}{\em Planet-Fixed} ~\cite{dynenv:PLANETFIXED} and the \href{file:\JEODHOME/models/utils/ref\_frames/docs/ref\_frames.pdf}{\em Reference Frames} ~\cite{dynenv:REFFRAMES} documentation for details.  These documents are also linked as appropriate in the detailed design section of this document.
