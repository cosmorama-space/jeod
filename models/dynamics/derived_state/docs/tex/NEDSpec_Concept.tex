%\section{Conceptual Design}
The \NEDDesc\ is used to express the state of a vehicle with respect to a planet-fixed, rotating reference frame in a reference frame oriented with local North, East, and Down directions.  The reference frame is defined by East, parallel to the equator (y-axis); Down, perpendicular to the surface (z-axis); and North (x-axis) completes the right-handed coordinate system.  North is not, in general, aligned with the magnetic field, nor the planetary spin axis.

The calculations associated with representing the state in this way are handled by the North-East-Down subset of the planet-fixed model;  see the \href{file:\JEODHOME/models/utils/planet_fixed/docs/planet_fixed.pdf}{\em Planet-Fixed document}~\cite{dynenv:PLANETFIXED} for details.
