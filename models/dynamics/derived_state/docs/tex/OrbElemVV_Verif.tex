\inspection{State Encapsulation}\label{inspect:OrbElem}
 The \OrbElemDesc\ is capable of outputting data as desired, as demonstrated in simulation \textit{derived\_state/verif/OrbElem/SIM\_OrbElem/}, thereby satisfying
 requirement \ref{reqt:OrbElem} at the inspection level.  See the 
\href{file:\JEODHOME/models/utils/orbital_elements/docs/orbital_elements.pdf}{Orbital Elements document}~\cite{dynenv:ORBITALELEMENTS} for verification of the Orbital Elements calculations.
