\section{Purpose and Objectives of the \DerivedStateDesc}
\input{DerivedStateIntroduction}

\section{Context within JEOD}
The following document is parent to this document:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\href{file:\JEODHOME/docs/JEOD.pdf}
           {\em JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics}}
			  \cite{dynenv:JEOD}
\end{itemize}

The \DerivedStateDesc\ forms a component of the \ModelClass\ suite of
models within \JEODid. It is located at
models/\ModelClass/derived\_state.  

\section{Documentation History}
\input{DerivedStateIntro_change_history}


\section{Documentation Organization}
This document is formatted in accordance with the 
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard~\cite{NASA:SWE}.  The document comprises several parts.  The first part is an overview of the model; each subsequent part describes a sub-model of the \DerivedStateDesc, with each sub-model representing an independent reference frame or state representation.  Each part is organized into a similar structure, comprising the following chapters in order:

\begin{description}
%% longer chapter descriptions, more information.

\item[Introduction] - 
This introduction describes the objective and purpose of the object of the respective part; the introduction in Part I - Overview also contains the document history.

\item[Product Requirements] -
Describes requirements for the object of the respective part.

\item[Product Specification] -
Describes the underlying theory, architecture, and design of the
object of the respective part in detail.  It will be organized into the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conceptual Design.
 \item Mathematical Formulations.
 \item Detailed Design.
 \item Version Inventory (Part I - Overview only).
\end{itemize}
 

\item[User's Guide] -
Describes how to use the object of the respective part in a Trick simulation.  The User's Guide for each sub-model
is divided into three sections to represent the JEOD defined user types:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Analysts or users of simulations (Analysis).
 \item Integrators or developers of simulations (Integration).
 \item Model Extenders (Extension).
\end{itemize}
 
\item[Verification and Validation] -
Contains verification and validation procedures and
results for the object of the resepctive part.

\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall meet the JEOD project requirements specified in
  the \JEODid\
  \hyperref{file:\JEODHOME/docs/JEOD.pdf}{part1}{reqt}{ top-level
  document}.
\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  This model shall, at a minimum,  meet all external and
  internal requirements 
  applied to the \JEODid\ release.
\item[Verification:]\ \newline

\chapter{User's Guide}\hyperdef{part}{user}{}\label{ch:user}
%----------------------------------
The top level of the \DerivedStateDesc\ should not be used directly in a simulation.  Specific instances of the \DerivedStateDesc\ should be used instead, although the implementation varies from instance to instance.  See the User's Guides in the respective Part of this document for details of specific implementation.
