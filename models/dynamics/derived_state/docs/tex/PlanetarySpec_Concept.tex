%\section{Conceptual Design}

The \PlanetaryDesc\ is used to express the state of a vehicle with respect to a planet-fixed, rotating reference frame.  This is useful, for example, for finding the position of a vehicle with respect to some fixed point on a planetary surface, or for plotting a vehicle trajectory over a map of a planet.

There are three methods for presenting the state, these are described in the \textref{Introduction}{ch:planetaryintro}.
