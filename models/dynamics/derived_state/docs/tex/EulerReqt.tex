% add text here to describe general model requirements
% text is of the form:
\requirement{Calculate relative attitude between two reference frames}
\label{reqt:Euler}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
     Given a reference frame associated with a body, the \EulerDesc\ will calculate an Euler-type angle sequence from body frame to the reference frame parent to it, and from the parent frame to the body frame using the 3 basic axes, represented as roll(x-axis rotation), pitch (y-axis rotation), and yaw (z-axis rotation).
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
     To provide a means of expressing relative attitude between reference frames.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
     Test
