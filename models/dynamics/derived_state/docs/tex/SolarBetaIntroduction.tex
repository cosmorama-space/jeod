%\section{Purpose and Objectives of \SolarBetaDesc}
% Incorporate the intro paragraph that used to begin this Chapter here. 
% This is location of the true introduction where you explain what this model 
% does.

Spacecraft with movable solar panels and thermal radiators
continuously rotate the solar panels to catch as much sunlight as possible
and rotate the thermal radiators to catch as little sunlight as possible.
The varying orientations of these devices present ever changing cross sections
to atmospheric drag. Properly modeling the orientation of these devices
improves the fidelity of simulation of such spacecraft.

One of the principal drivers of these panel orientations is the angle between
the vector toward the sun and the spacecraft's orbital plane, which is called
the {\em solar beta angle}. The \SolarBetaDesc\ represents this angle.

This part of the document describes the \SolarBetaDesc\ developed for use with \JEODid.
