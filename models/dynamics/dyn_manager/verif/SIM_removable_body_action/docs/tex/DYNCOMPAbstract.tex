\begin{abstract}
Regression testing of the JSC Engineering Dynamics (JEOD) software is required in order
to assure the user and any clients regarding the validity of the results of the simulation.
There are many levels of software verification; the focus of \DYNCOMPDesc\ is the
establishment of set of tests using the numerical output of the simulation compared
against other simulation data and simple analytic unit tests. The goal of this
subset of validation testing of JEOD is a demonstration that the software meets the
purposes and requirements of the over all project when new versions of the software
is issued.
