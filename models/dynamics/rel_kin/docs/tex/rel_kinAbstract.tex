\begin{abstract}

The JEOD \relkinDesc\ enables centralized management and calculation of the
states of multiple points of interest associated with a particular Dynamics
Body, relative to some other reference frame.  These points can be anywhere
in relation to the Dynamics Body, and the other reference frame can be any
type of reference frame. All points of interest can be updated in batch
fashion, or individual points can be updated.  The \relkinDesc\ does no
calculations on its own, but instead serves as a ``manager'' class that
orchestrates a set of user-defined Relative Derived States as desired
by the user to accomplish these capabilities.

This document describes the implementation of the \relkinDesc\ including
the model requirements, specifications, and architecture.  A user guide
is provided to assist with implementing the model in Trick simulations.
Finally, the methods and results of verification and validation of the
model are included.
