%----------------------------------

\requirement{Top-level requirement}
\label{reqt:overview:top_level}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall meet the JEOD project-wide requirements specified in
  the \JEODid\ \hyperTLDinside{part}{reqt}{requirements}.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  This is a project-wide requirement.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection
\end{description}


\requirement[Base class]{Body Action Base Class}
\label{reqt:overview:base_class}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  All action classes that modify aspects of a MassBody, DynBody or derived class instance
  shall derive from a common base class.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A common base class enables external functional users of the
  model to refer to any of the model object in terms of a base
  class pointer.

\item[Remarks:]\ \newline
  This requirement does not pertain to the \ModelDesc message class,
  BodyActionMessages. That class does not modify aspects of a subject body.
  It instead defines error and message IDs used
  for interaction with the JEOD Message Handler.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection
\end{description}

\requirement{Subject Specification}
\label{reqt:overview:subject_body}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  Each instance of the classes defined by this model
  shall designate a MassBody or DynBody object as the primary subject
  of the model instance.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  The goal of this model is to alter various aspects of an object, therefore
  the object must be known to the action instance.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection
\end{description}

\requirement{Initialize Mass Properties}
\label{reqt:overview:mass_ppty_init}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to
  initialize the mass properties of a MassBody object.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for initializing key aspects of MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection
\end{description}

\requirement{Initialize Mass Points}
\label{reqt:overview:mass_point_init}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to specify the
  points of interest on MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for initializing key aspects of MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Attach MassBody and DynBody Objects}
\label{reqt:overview:mass_attach}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to attach one MassBody object
  to another, one DynBody to another, a MassBody as a child attachment to a
  DynBody, or a DynBody to a RefFrame. The model shall not provide the ability to attach a DynBody as a
  child attachment to a MassBody.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for initializing key aspects of
  and for performing asynchronous operations on
  MassBody and DynBody objects. The DynBody model specifies that it may not
  attach as a child to a MassBody, which is stateless.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement{Detach MassBody and DynBody Objects}
\label{reqt:overview:mass_detach}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to detach one MassBody object
  from another, detach one DynBody from another, detach a MassBody from a
  DynBody, and detach a DynBody from a RefFrame.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for performing asynchronous operations on
  MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[State initialization]{Initialize DynBody State}
\label{reqt:overview:dyn_body_init}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to
  initialize the dynamic state (position, velocity,
  attitude, and rate) of a DynBody object.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for initializing key aspects of MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Frame switch]{Switch DynBody Integration Frame}
\label{reqt:overview:frame_switch}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  This model shall provide the ability to switch the
  frame in which a DynBody object's state is represented
  and propagated.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  A driving goal of this model is to provide a common interface
  for performing asynchronous operations on
  MassBody and DynBody objects.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Errors]{Error Detection and Handling}
\label{reqt:overview:errors}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  The \ModelDesc shall detect and handle erroneous conditions.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  All models, and particularly those that deal with user inputs,
  must address erroneous conditions.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Trace]{Trace Capability}
\label{reqt:overview:debug}
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement:]\ \newline
  The \ModelDesc shall provide a (disable-able) ability to
  summarize actions performed on the subject objects.

\item[Rationale:]\ \newline
  This capability is needed for error handling and message generation.

\item[Verification:]\ \newline
  Inspection, Test
\end{description}
