\chapter{Product Requirements}\label{ch:\modelpartid:reqt}


\requirement{Frame Switch}
\label{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    This class shall provide the ability
    to change the frame in which a DynBody object's
    state is represented and propagated.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    This is the primary purpose of this class.
    This requirement derives directly from
    requirement~\ref{reqt:overview:frame_switch}.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Continuity]{Frame Switch Continuity}
\label{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch_continuity}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    To within numerical precision,
    this class shall maintain a continuous state
    for the vehicle with respect to the closest common
    ancestor of to the two integration frames
    when the frame switch is performed.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    This class defers the mathematical details of switching integration
    frames to the DynBody class. This requirement is also levied
    on the Dynamics Body model.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Switch on entry]{Frame Switch on Entering the Sphere of Influence}
\label{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch_on_entry}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    This class shall provide the ability
    to trigger the change from one integration frame to another
    when the vehicle
    enters the sphere of influence of the new integration frame.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    Refinement of requirement~\ref{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch}.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}

\requirement[Switch on exit]{Frame Switch on Exiting the Sphere of Influence}
\label{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch_on_exit}
\begin{description}
  \item[Requirement:]\ \newline
    This class shall provide the ability
    to trigger the change from one integration frame to another
    when the vehicle
    exits the sphere of influence of the current integration frame.
  \item[Rationale:]\ \newline
    Refinement of requirement~\ref{reqt:DynBodyFrameSwitch:frame_switch}.
  \item[Verification:]\ \newline
    Inspection, Test
\end{description}
