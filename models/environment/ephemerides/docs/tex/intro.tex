This document describes the \ModelDesc.\footnote{``An
ephemeris is a tabulation of computed positions and velocities (and/or 
various derived quantities such as right ascension and declination) of an 
orbiting body at specific times.  The plural form of ephemeris is ephemerides."  
Reference: JPL Solar System Dynamics web page

The \ModelDesc addresses the
problems of building the heavenly body basis of the JEOD reference frame tree
and of representing the translational and rotational states of those heavenly
bodies.
