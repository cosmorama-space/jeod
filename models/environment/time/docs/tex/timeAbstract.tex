The \timeDesc\ in \JEODid\ represents a 
complete reformulation from the UTIME structure seen in JEOD1.x.  Like 
its predecessor, it is responsible for tracking time as a simulation 
advances; unlike its predecessor, it can do so in any number of time 
representations, using any number of clocks, that may be ticking at 
different rates from one another.

The \timeDesc\ accurately represents
the most commonly used reference times throughout a simulation, and
includes the capacity to control additional user-specified time
references.
