\section{Mathematical Formulations}


The mathematics of the \timeDesc\ model is remarkably simple, with little
beyond basic addition and subtraction of time increments and offsets. 
The major exceptions are in the functions
\textref{convert\_from\_calendar}{ref:convertfromcalendar} and 
\textref{calculate\_calendar\_values}{ref:calculatecalendarvalues}, which are
described in the \textref{Functional Design}{ref:FunctionalDesign} section of the Product
Specification.
