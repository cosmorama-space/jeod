\begin{abstract}

The JEOD \planetDesc\ is primarily a container model in which information for
a particular planetary body is stored. The parent BasePlanet object contains
both an inertial and a planet-fixed reference frame, though the \planetDesc\
plays no role in updating or maintaining either of them.

The derived-class Planet object is ellipsoidal-body specific, as it contains
planetary shape constants that are only valid for an ellipsoid. The Planet class
also contains a connection to the GravitySource structure associated with the
same planetary body.

This document describes the implementation of the \planetDesc\ including
the model requirements, specifications, mathematical theory,
and architecture.  A user guide is provided to assist
with implementing the model in Trick simulations.  Finally, the methods and
results of verification and validation of the model are included.
