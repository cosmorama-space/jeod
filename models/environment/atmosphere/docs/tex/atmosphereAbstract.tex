\begin{abstract}

Aerodynamic effects can greatly influence the dynamics of an orbiting
spacecraft. These aerodynamic effects depend greatly on modeling of both
the Earth's atmosphere, as well as winds present in the
atmosphere. Needed elements from the atmosphere include density, pressure, and
temperature, as well as wind velocity.

This document presents the \JEODid\ \atmosphereDesc\ framework, designed as
a generic interface for the modeling of planet atmospheres. This framework
is extensible. This allows for reuse of code by different atmosphere models,
including models for bodies other than the Earth, while taking advantage of a common
framework.

This document also presents a specific implementation of the generic JEOD
atmosphere framework. This specific implementaion is of the Marshall Engineering
Thermosphere (MET) Model, an Earth-based atmosphere model. This implementation
provides atmospheric pressure, temperature, and density, as well as other
parameters specific to the MET Model, based on the current geodetic position
and altitude.
