NASA's Navigation Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) offers NASA flight
projects and NASA funded researchers an observation geometry information
system called ``SPICE.'' Among other things, SPICE provides ephemerides for
hundreds of natural and man-made objects in the solar system as well as
orientation data for planets and moons which have orientation models.

The JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics (JEOD) software includes a reference
frame model which relies on the concept of the frames having parents, where
each frame is defined with respect to its parent. The goal then is to use
SPICE to extend JEOD's built-in frame concept to any celestial object of
interest in a seamless way. To this end, it is necessary to derive both the
relational and mathematical components of a JEOD frame from information
provided by SPICE.
