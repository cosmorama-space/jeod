The \SpiceDesc\ is a first step toward replacement of custom JEOD code with
an agency standard library (SPICE). The \SpiceDesc\ provides identical
functionality to the existing JEOD models with the single exception of the
high fidelity JEOD model for Mars orientation. In addition, the \SpiceDesc\
includes high fidelity ephemerides and simple (International Astronomical
Union) orientation models for planets, natural satellites, asteroids, comets,
and many other objects and locations of interest in the solar system. Moreover,
JPL maintains archives of the data files (called kernels) that drive the
ephemerides and orientation models of the \SpiceDesc, which are updated
as higher fidelity models become available. This has the effect of
``future-proofing'' JEOD while removing the requirement to maintain and update
over 60,000 lines of code in the legacy ephemerides and RNP models.
